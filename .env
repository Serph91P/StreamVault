You can use a simple string like, “this is my secret”; however, you should consider using a random byte generator meant for cryptography. The secret used in this topic was generated using crypto.randomBytes(32) to create 32 random bytes. The 32 random bytes were converted to HEX to create an ASCII string, 64 characters long.
