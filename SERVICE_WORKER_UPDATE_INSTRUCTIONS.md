# Service Worker Update Instructions

## Problem
The Service Worker was intercepting video streaming requests and preventing videos from loading correctly.

## Solution
I have updated the Service Worker so it no longer intercepts video streaming requests.

## Instructions for Activation
Since the Service Worker is cached in the browser, you need to follow these steps:

### Option 1: Clear Browser Cache (Recommended)
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the "Application" tab (Chrome) or "Storage" tab (Firefox)
3. Click on "Service Workers" on the left
4. Click "Unregister" for the StreamVault Service Worker
5. Reload the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
6. The new Service Worker will be installed automatically

### Option 2: Hard Refresh
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. This reloads the page and bypasses the cache

### Option 3: Incognito/Private Browsing
1. Open the page in an Incognito/Private browsing window
2. Test if the videos work

## Changes in the Service Worker
- Video streaming requests (`/api/videos/stream/`) are no longer intercepted
- Range requests are passed directly to the browser
- Cache version increased to v10 for automatic updates

## Verification
After the update, you should see the following message in the browser console:
```
Service Worker: Skipping video/audio request: /api/videos/stream/452
```

This confirms that the new Service Worker is active and no longer intercepts video requests.

## Backend Improvements
Additionally, the following improvements were made to the backend:
- `Cache-Control: no-cache` headers for video streaming
- Better error handling in video routes
- Improved logging for debugging

After these changes, videos should load and play correctly.
