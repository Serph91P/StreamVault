# Fix for Recording Service Logging UnboundLocalError

## Issue
The `_remux_to_mp4_with_logging` method in `recording_service.py` was throwing an `UnboundLocalError` for the `logging_service` variable at line 1557 during remuxing operations.

## Root Cause
The method had duplicate and dead code after a `return True` statement, including an erroneous local import of `logging_service`:

```python
return True
from app.services.logging_service import logging_service  # This was causing the issue
```

This caused Python to treat `logging_service` as a local variable that needed to be assigned before use, but the code was trying to use the global `logging_service` import earlier in the method.

## Solution
1. **Removed dead code**: Deleted all unreachable code after the first `return True` statement in the `_remux_to_mp4_with_logging` method.

2. **Cleaned up method structure**: The method now has a proper structure:
   - Main logic block
   - Success return (`return True`)
   - Exception handling with proper error logging
   - Error return (`return False`)

3. **Preserved global import**: The global import `from app.services.logging_service import logging_service` remains at the top of the file and is used correctly throughout the method.

## Files Modified
- `app/services/recording_service.py`: Fixed `_remux_to_mp4_with_logging` method by removing dead code and duplicate imports.

## Testing
- Python syntax compilation: ✅ No syntax errors
- Import test: ✅ Logging service imports successfully
- Code structure: ✅ Method properly structured with exception handling

## Impact
This fix resolves the `UnboundLocalError` that was preventing the remuxing process from completing successfully. The logging and notification systems should now work correctly during recording operations.

## Migration Notes
No database migrations or configuration changes are required for this fix. The change is purely a code cleanup that resolves a runtime error.
